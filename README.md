Paypal acquired Venmo in 2013, and its current valuation is $38 billion. Venmo facilitates digital payments, that includes instant transfer, and electronic payments with no fee.

The core metrics in this domain are Teenagers, Technology evolution, Social Media, Marketing, Banking data, Credit data and so on. The companies in this domain use these core metrics to measure thier success. Venmo has been using these metrics as well;

 **Social Media** - 302.35 million Americans use social media currently and Venmo’s most users are active on social media.

 **Marketing** - Venmo has been using digital marketing as a tool for success.

 **Banking Data** - Venmo gathers information through banking data and utilizes it to attract customers by sharing policies.

 Venmo has been performing relatively better than its competitors like Zelle, Cash App. One of the example is, 

 **Venmo** -	it covers all unauthorized transactions as long as it is notified within 60 days.

 **Cash App** -	it covers only certain amount of unauthorized transactions as long as it is notified within two days.

 **Zelle** -	it do not cover any unauthorized transactions.

 Venmo's interface is smiliar to social media interface, this results in attracting young generation, users can also express their views through emoji’s, whereas other competitors do not have these features.
Venom provide different types of services like Debit card, credit card, they also have a feature for users to earn cashback for their purchase. Venmo also allows to purchase cryptocurrency.


## Recommendations
I would like to suggest a couple of services to venmo. It would be a good idea to allow users to book online tickets (such as airline, train, hotel, concerts etc.). Also, it would be ideal to upgrade the app for user to chat, shop, and pay the bills and Venmo could provide cashback, discount features as well to attract the customers. Chatbots for real-time assistance can help in customer service.
These services would help increase the revenue with the increase in number of users.

These recommended services would allow users to have “one stop shop” where they can purchase from their favorite stores with discount and gain cashback. This can be a win-win for everyone (Company, Merchandise, and Customer).
Users can use Venmo as a “one stop all payments service”, where they can make payments for Insurance, utilities, Phone bills etc.. Venmo can send the notifications for future payments, this feature can benefit people who do not want to enable autopayments.

By introducing these services, Venmo will gain more users, and will have multiple clients, and results in revenue generation, that benefits in company’s growth.

E-commerce and API can be used for these recommended services and AI technology would improvise these services. API is an Application Programming Interface used in online payment services. If Venmo implements online payments services, then API should be considered.
